### Project Step 2

**Introduction:**

RecipeHelp started originally one night when I had no idea what I wanted to make for dinner.  I had a handful of ingredients, but I knew of no recipes with which to form them into anything that was dinner worthy.  I thought if only I had an app that I could input ingredients into and get a list of great recipes that I could make from the ingredients. The RecipeHelp application will help a cook in need of fresh ideas by providing recipes from different cuisines, complexities and difficulties based on ingredients on hand.

**Ingredient Input:**

A user will be able to take stock of ingredients that they have on hand and enter them into the app via a web GUI.  The program will compare ingredients to recipes in the database and send the user recipes based on ingredients specified as well as filters and accuracy.  The program will employ an algorithm that attains a percentage of recipe accuracy which can be configured by the use.  The user will be able to set different filters on the recipes they are requesting.  The filters will include cook time, skill level, budget, and cuisine.  

**User Accounts:**

The user will be able to create an account in order to personalize specific aspects of the application.  These options will include the ability to favorite recipes for quick access when logging in multiple times as well as the ability to share recipes to contacts outside of the app.  The user will have to have the option to put personal preferences on their account by setting “global” parameters for certain diet restrictions.  The user will also be able to upload a profile picture.  The account system will not store anything other than the user’s email, username, and password.

**Recipe sharing:**

The user will be able to upload custom recipes to the database via the GUI.   The GUI will display a message to the user annotating if the recipe is a duplicate or not.  If the recipe is not a duplicate, the recipe will be added to the database with the user as the author.  This recipe will be shared to other users when they do the ingredient search and will display the creator’s name.  If a user feels the need, they are able to delete previous recipe entries that they have made from the database.  
 
**Shopping Cart:**

If the user is presented with a recipe that requires more ingredients than the amount they input previously, they will have the option to add the extra ingredients to a virtual cart.  This cart will be available to the user when shopping for the necessary ingredients and will be available for download in the case of offline access.
